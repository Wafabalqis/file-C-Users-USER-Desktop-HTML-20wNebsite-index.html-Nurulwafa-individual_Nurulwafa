	 <p style="text-align:"center;"><b><i> Actually, I have a lot that I want to say about my experiences, but I just simplify the whole year 2020 and 2021.My experience starting during our country got the Covid-19, very suprising the whole world.Not only student,most of people.
                                          I must faced on Online learning at home that for the first time never thought easy to study alone at home but I must accept it.
										  Therefore,it is very meaningful memories to me because from that I learn how to be systematic with time management that before this I just ignore it.
										  Besides that,it teach me how to study and struggling to wake up during class in early morning, doing assignment and record video presentation.
										  It quite struggle and hard but I trying to be positive whatever I do.I just follow and do eventhough it hard and difficuilt.From there I learn what can I or what skills that I have if I alone? Because all this time, I totally relay on my teamates at the past semester.
										  This 2 semester, I woke up that I cannot relay on people,I must independant.I starting find my team for grouping assignment.Thankfull,Annesa and Balqis,they want join me,before this I worked together both of them.
										  I am very grateful because my group mate always help me and really understand what I want and they really the best group mate.
										  Annesa,Balqis and Yana. Eventhough, I never face to face with Yana since she is enter our class, but I happy and grateful with her 
										  that always give the best when doing assignment. To Annesa and Balqis thank you for understanding me and always be my back, 
										  and always give your best to our each assignment.Here I put my pictures team also that really work hard all this semester.I love them much.Last but not least, I hope we all can get meet together since Covid-19 we not meet
										  even we already have video call when discussing assignment. I hope we can get our last journey during 5 semester with successfull and graduation together.
